		<p>This site try to get response to the problem of <strong>food combining</strong>. Are we eating by a correct way? This is one of the most important questions if we think about <strong>health</strong>. The <strong>Kiwibit application</strong> is being developed with this goal: <strong>find the better food combination</strong>, in order to get the perfect amount of each nutrient, depending on our particular needs.</p>
		<p>This is quite a big problem, in which we need the power of computering to go on. The implementation is made by a <strong>genetic algorithm</strong> (I am going to explain this a little bit later, but in general terms it is the faster way that I could find to solve the problem).</p>
		<p><strong>Be care with the data</strong> that the software provides. It takes information from the Internet, and it is made by a single person, so it could content (I hope not) mistakes. Use the results at your own risk.</p>
