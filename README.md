# Kiwibit

Kiwibit will be a nutritional web application allowing you to organize the meals for the week while providing you with nutritional values and other metrics to help you stay healthy.

If you wish to collaborate, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/inad9300/kiwibit/issues). If you are trully willing to contribute, I will add you as a project collaborator.

You can visit the [planning board](https://github.com/inad9300/kiwibit/projects/1?fullscreen=true) for an idea of the features the application will eventually have.
